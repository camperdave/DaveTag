DaveTag - automatically move music files to where they belong, based on their metadata
Copyright (C) 2011  David Lee (aka camperdave)

As it says on the tin, this is a simple script to move music files around based on their metadata. I loved this feature in iTunes, so I wrote a python script to simulate it for use with other media players (especially foobar2000)


TODO:

* Get music files in other formats and test it with them - it's probably 90% compatible with ogg, flac, ape etc etc
* Uses depreciated m4a class rather than mp4, because I'm lazy. Fix this.
* Bad characters in filename / paths are handled terribly. Fix exentually?
